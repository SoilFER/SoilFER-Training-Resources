# SoilFER: Capacity development in

# Soil Information and Data

The Soil Mapping for Resilient Agrifood Systems (SoilFER) programme aims to develop sustainable national capacities in beneficiary countries (Guatemala, Honduras, Zambia, Kenya, Ghana, Mozambique, and Tunisia) to generate, manage, and sustain standardized soil information systems that support evidence-based decision-making. This effort is anchored in two complementary activities:

•	Activity 1.8 of the SoilFER project (GCP/GLO/1127/USA): development of an online training platform and capacity development in digital soil mapping and modelling.

•	Activity 1.5 of the SoilFER-VACS project (GCP/GLO/1242/JPN): training in soil survey, soil spectroscopy, mapping, and data management, including regional workshops.

•	Activity 3.6 of the SoilFER project (GCP/GLO/1127/USA): dissemination of results and exchange of experiences through Regional Capacity Development Workshops in Sub-Saharan Africa and Central America.

The programme delivers a structured six-module curriculum covering the entire soil information cycle, from data science basics and soil sampling, to soil spectroscopy, digital soil mapping, and dissemination through soil information systems aligned with the Global Soil Information System (GloSIS). Modules are interconnected and designed to ensure continuity, using harmonized training materials and a single example dataset.
