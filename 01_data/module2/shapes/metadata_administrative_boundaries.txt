High resolution, World Bank-approved administrative boundaries. Each download option (shapefile, GeoPackage, or GeoJSON format) includes Admin 0, 1, 2, Non-Determined Legal Status Areas (NDLSA), and an ocean mask. An Admin 0 line file (for visualization purposes with World Bank-specific drawing instructions) can also be found in the shapefile folder. A data dictionary and additional columns of information which can be joined to the Admin 1 and 2 files are available as separate downloads. 

Also included are API endpoints for interactive maps. 

If Bank staff use this data to create a map- print, web, presentations for an external audience (e.g. external web sites), etc., staff must receive legal clearance by submitting the finished map to the World Bank Cartography Unit.

To report an error in any of the admin boundary files, please raise a new issue here: https://github.com/worldbank/WB_GAD/issues and it will be considered during the next update cycle.
